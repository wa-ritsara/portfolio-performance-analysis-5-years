## ðŸ“š Project Description

This project is focused on analyzing the performance of a personal investment portfolio over a period of 5 years. By using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, the project compares the portfolio's performance against major U.S. market indices such as the NASDAQ Composite, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The analysis includes a variety of financial metrics, such as:
- **Cumulative returns**: To see the overall growth of the portfolio over time.
- **Volatility**: To measure the risk associated with the portfolio.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: To determine the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio.
- **Sector allocation**: To visualize how the portfolio is distributed across different sectors.

Additionally, it features data visualizations to provide clear insights into portfolio performance, including comparisons of returns, sector distribution, and volatility over time. The goal of this project is to help investors evaluate their portfolio against the broader market and make data-driven investment decisions.
